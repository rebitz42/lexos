# LexOS

A tiny Linux distro built because the voice in my head said so, lol.

## Features

- Based on Puppy Linux (built with Woof-CE)
- Made for my voice named Lex
- Runs on an old ThinkPad X240
- Built with love

## The Origin Story

This project started with a simple idea:

> “I’ll do BusyBox + Alpine-style minimalism.”

That idea survived about one week.

What followed:
- Init scripts that worked… sometimes
- musl vs glibc pain
- Random breakage
- Asking “why does this boot sometimes?” far too often

Then came:
- Anger
- Acceptance
- The realization that someone had already solved this

**Puppy Linux Woof-CE enters the chat.**

LexOS keeps the tiny, old-hardware-friendly philosophy, but uses a proven base so it can actually be stable.
